# JSL Django Sitemap

JSL Django Sitemap is a Django utility which iterates over all the url patterns in your main Django project and creates a
ready to use sitemap. The sitemap.xml is useful in crawlers such as Google, Bing, Yahoo. We hope you like our app! Leave
a star on our GitHub repository. Thanks!
